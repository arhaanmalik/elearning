    <br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>TIKU  MOHAMMD & MM IBHRAHIM (Founder of GLOCAL LEARNERS)</h2><br>
    
        
      <p>Hi, first of all, thanks for visiting this page. This page is all about us - Tiku Mohammd & MM Ibhrahim (Founder of GLOCAL LEARNERS ). You will get exciting things about our life.</p>
      
      <p><strong>About GLOCAL LEARNERS:</strong></p>
      <p><em>Success is all about taking new initiatives.</em> We started developing GLOCAL LEARNERS in the fabuary 2021. At that time,  At this time,we are providing training on Java, C, C++,Web Technology, Android, AutoCAD, . Meanwhile, We thought, why not to spread our knowledge to the world. So we started developing GLOCAL LEARNERS.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Why we started the GLOCAL LEARNERS:</strong></p>
      <p><em>If you try to help others, God will help you surely.</em> .</p>
      
      <p><strong>Why GLOCAL LEARNERS Name:</strong></p>
      <p>We searched a lot of good names on the web, but all were registered. Since we are doing our B.tech in GLOCAL UNIVERSITY,  So we just added GLOCAL with  LEARNERS and checked on the net if it is registered or not. Thankfully, It was not registered. So, We are going to register this domain. In my opinion, <em>name doesn't matter too much, work matters a lot</em>. We thought, if we could work better to the existing site, it will be famous one day. And, thank God, now all the software professionals and students know about it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>About Us:</strong></p>
      <p>What to say about ourself, We don't know. We are simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing.
        <br><br><br>Tiku Mohammd  born in Behat, Saharanpur, UP, India. It is near to Dehradun. Currently, Tiku Mohammd is living in saharanpur, UP.<br><br><br>
          MM Ibhrahim  born in Manipur, India.  Currently, MM Ibhrahim is  living in saharanpur,UP.<br><br>
        </p>
      
      <p><strong>Sports:</strong></p>
      <p><em>If you play sports, you fail sometimes, and it teaches you keep going.</em> In childhood, We were enjoying playing games like I Spy, Lattu (spinning top), Flying kite, Gilli Danda, Badminton, Ludo and marble (kancha). Later on I (Tiku Mohammd) started playing Cricket, I played cricket to District Level, I played too many tournaments, and host one tournament also. After the 12th, I left everything, because I was out of home. </p>
      
      
      <h2>Tiku's Education </h2>
          <p> My grandfather was supporting a school, so I got education from 1 to 3 in the school, I don't have too many memories of that time, I was using kalam-dawat, there was no pencil or pen facility, electricity was the main problem there. I was using Dhebri (handmade with medicine bottle, kerosene oil and a cloth), later on Lantern. There were only 4-5 hours electricity available at that time.
             I studied 4th and 8th in B.S junior High School, Kambohmajra.  after that, I studied 9th to 12th in the yamuna khader inter college (government school) because of the better education.
            After that I took admission in glocal university in 2018 in B.Tech Computer Science
             </p>

             <h2>MM's Education</h2>
             <p> My grandfather was supporting a school, so I got education from 1 to 8th in the school, we don't have too many memories of that time.  after that, I studied 9th to 12th in the government school because of the better education.
              After that I took admission in glocal university in 2018 in B.Tech Computer Science.</p>
     
    


      <p><strong>Failures:</strong></p>
      <p><em>You can't get success without failures</em>. After doing the 8th, I was not able to crack the entrance exam of a college. After doing the 12th, I failed in the entrance exam of BA. It happened because I was weak in General Knowledge at that time. But, I was the master of my subject.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Struggle:</strong></p>
      <p><em>You can't get success without struggle, determination, hard work and decision-making ability</em>. I don't want to specify my struggle here because, in the end, result matters. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Future Aspect:</strong></p>
      <p>I always think: <em>"It's just a beginning"</em>. I have to achieve more. <em>I want to see my growth endless</em>. It's not my dream to touch the sky, I want to go beyond the sky. Finally, I would like to say, It's just the beginning.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Belief in God:</strong></p>
      <p><em>I have a strong belief in the existence of God</em>. I think we are made of energy. One day, we will lose our energy (Aatma in Hindi), and it will go to the God again (Parmatma in Hindi).</p>
      
      <p><strong>About Success:</strong></p>
      <p>Everybody has different thoughts on Success. What are the key points to get successful? Luck! May be but not all the time. There are a lot of factors that makes a person successful: positive thinking nature, your goal: you must know what do you have to do in life, decision-making ability, your working nature in setback and failures, time management: what are you doing now and what will you do in future, ready to take risks, and innovative ideas.</p>
      <p><em>Being ideal defines your success</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>At the end:</strong></p>
      <p><em>Death is the bitter truth of life</em> and it is the universal truth. But, before this, I have to do something inspiring, and be an ideal.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Be My Friend:</strong></p>
      <p>I always like to make new friends. Follow me on Facebook or Instagram and be connected with me.</p>
